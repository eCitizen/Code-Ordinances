Development repository for structure and format for City of Boston ordinances.  This research project seeks to provide Boston ordinances as data files that can be accessed in both human readable form (using markdown and html for example) and in machine processable form (using json and xml, for example) in a network accessible manner any developer can write an app or service to access or integrate with and any person can access with a browser, navigate, copy and annotate.  GitHub demonstrates each of these functions when configured appropraitely for the purpose of version control and file access to versions of legal data.  


This research project specifically seeks to apply the [statedecoded API](http://statedecoded.github.io/documentation/api.html) and, in collaboration with the [LegalPhysics](http://legalphysics.org) team of MIT Media Lab's [Human Dynamics Group](http://hd.media.mit.edu) to develop and extend the data structure, formats and API functionality of statedecoded so as to meaningfully support access to date and other time based ways of sorting, filtering, searching, integrating, visualiing and otherwise computing the law.  


In coordination and collaboration with the [statedecoded project](http://www.statedecoded.com/), the LegalPhysics team of MIT seeks to help formulate this project and resulting code base as a reusable, scalable open standards, open data, open source, open formats and open architecture model thereby enabling and encouraging other local, state and federal entities can easily follow when making their own laws, regulations and other rules available as open, public information assets.


In consultation with legal, policy and other key stakeholders, this project also seeks to address the factors and requirements necessary for the [authoritative and official source](http://civics.com/law-or-not-law/) of this municipal information to exist as a publicly accessible, REST interface-available, data-driven, service-aware resource ... such as this City of Boston GitHub repository.
